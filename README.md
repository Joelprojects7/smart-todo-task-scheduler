AI Smart Task(T-Buddy): it is an AI tool used for Scheduling your tasks and asking ai to reschedule your tasks based on the priority which will help you in doing your tasks on time and preventing the deadline



ðŸš€ Features
Priority-Based Task Rearrangement
1.Dynamic Prioritization:

Tasks are automatically rearranged based on their priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

High-priority tasks are moved to the top of the list, while low-priority tasks are pushed down.

User-Defined Priorities:

Users can manually set task priorities, and the AI will respect these settings while rearranging tasks.

2. Deadline Awareness
Urgency Detection:

The AI analyzes task deadlines and moves tasks with approaching deadlines higher in the list.

Tasks with no deadlines are treated as low priority by default.

Countdown Timers:

Each task displays a countdown timer showing how much time is left until the deadline.

3. Contextual Rescheduling
Time Estimation:

The AI estimates how long each task will take to complete based on historical data or user input.

It rearranges tasks to ensure that high-priority tasks with shorter completion times are addressed first.

Task Dependencies:

The AI identifies tasks that depend on the completion of other tasks and schedules them accordingly.

4. Smart Notifications
Reminders:

Users receive reminders for high-priority tasks and tasks with approaching deadlines.

Proactive Alerts:

The AI sends alerts if it detects that a task is at risk of being delayed.

5. Integration with Calendars
Calendar Sync:

The AI integrates with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) to sync tasks and deadlines.

Time Blocking:

It automatically blocks time on the userâ€™s calendar for high-priority tasks.

6. AI-Powered Suggestions
Task Breakdown:

The AI suggests breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

Optimal Scheduling:

It recommends the best times to work on tasks based on the userâ€™s productivity patterns (e.g., morning vs. evening).
